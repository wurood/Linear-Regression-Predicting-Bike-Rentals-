# Linear-Regression-Predicting-Bike-Rentals-
#Description: The goal of this project is to predict the demand for bike sharing using linear regression. The demand is typically measured by the number of bikes rented in a given timeframe (e.g., hourly, daily). This can be a challenging task as the demand is influenced by various factors such as weather, time of day, seasonality, and other external conditions.
